# New Tab page

## EDIT

The brave team [already implemented this](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/19640). Go use that instead.


## Why?

Brave is a good browser. Really. ~~But there's an annoyingly large lack of customization, especially in the everyday New Tab page.~~

~~This is not a solution, rather a *workaround*.~~

~~Do this at your own will.~~

(this has been implemented already)

## How?

Clone this repository, set your your **new tab action** to open your **homepage**, then set your home page to point to this repository under the `file://` protocol plus `/home.html`.

e.g.

```
file:///home/user/custom-brave-new-tab/home.html
```

This was a weekend project, don't expect me to work on this any further. Fork it.
