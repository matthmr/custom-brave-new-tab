# New Tab page

### How it looks

![404 Not Found](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthmr/custom-brave-new-tab/main/assets/cnt-exhibit-2.git)



## Why?

Brave is a good browser. Really. But there's an annoyingly large lack of customization, especially in the everyday New Tab page.

This is not a solution, rather a *workaround*.

Do this at your own will.



## How?

Clone this repository, set your your **new tab action** to open your **homepage**, then set your home page to point to this repository under the `file://` protocol plus `/home.html`.

e.g.

```
file:///home/user/custom-brave-new-tab/home.html
```

This was a weekend project, don't expect me to work on this any further. Fork it.
